# Carbon-Footprint-DGS
CS 787 - Final Project - Decision Guidance Systems

This project mainly deals with generating the optimal levels of Carbon Footprint based on the user's inputs for a given household in the US. 

It has been implemented using Decision Guidance Analytics Language(DGAL) which runs the inputs through an optimizer and generates recommendations to achieve optimal output if the footprint is out of range.

There are three developers of the system at hand, namely Jagruthi Ashwath, Mohammed Wasef Mohiuddin and, Nikita Pradeep Patil. 

This system was developed as a final project implementation as a part of the requirements of the course CS 787 at George Mason University under the supervision and guidance of Professor Alexander Brodsky.
